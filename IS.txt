A: A function that converts input into a fixed-size string of characters.

Q2. What is SHA-256 used for?
A: It is a cryptographic hash function used for data integrity.

Q3. What is a MAC (Message Authentication Code)?
A: A code used to verify both the integrity and authenticity of a message.

Q4. What does HTTPS stand for?
A: Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure.

A: An attack aimed at disrupting the availability of a service.

Q3. What is IDS (Intrusion Detection System)?
A: A system that detects and alerts on suspicious network activity.

Q4. What is an intrusion prevention system (IPS)?
A: A system that not only detects but also prevents malicious activity.

Q5. What is multi-level security (MLS)?
A: A system where access to resources is based on security labels or classifications.

Unit VI: Cybercrime and Legal Aspects
Mapped CO: CO5

Q1. What is phishing?
A: A fraudulent attempt to obtain sensitive information by pretending to be a trustworthy entity.

Q2. What is cyberstalking?
A: The use of the internet to harass or stalk an individual.

A: It uses public and private keys for encryption and decryption, based on large prime factorization.

Q2. What is the Row-Column Transposition Cipher?
A: A cipher where the message is written in rows and then read column by column.

Q3. How does DES encrypt data?
A: DES applies 16 rounds of permutations, substitutions, and key mixing on 64-bit blocks.

Q4. What is Diffie-Hellman key exchange?
A: It enables two parties to securely exchange cryptographic keys over an insecure channel.

Q5. What is the Caesar Cipher shift used for?
A: It shifts letters of the plaintext by a fixed number, a basic form of substitution cipher.
