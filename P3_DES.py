# Question: What is DES?
# Answer: DES (Data Encryption Standard) is a symmetric-key block 
# cipher that encrypts data in 64-bit blocks using a 56-bit key 
# over 16 rounds of processing.

# Question: What is implemented in this code?
# Answer: This code implements a very simplified version of DES, 
# using only 1 round of encryption and a simplified key mixing 
# and permutation logic.

# Question: Why is the initial permutation (IP) used?
# Answer: The IP rearranges the 64-bit plaintext to prepare 
# it for the DES rounds. It's part of the original DES structure 
# to improve diffusion.

# Question: What does the `permute()` function do?
# Answer: It rearranges bits according to a permutation table. 
# It's used for both initial and final permutations in DES.

# Question: What is the role of `string_to_bits()`?
# Answer: It converts each character of a string to its 8-bit 
# binary representation, forming a list of bits.

# Question: What does `bits_to_string()` do?
# Answer: It converts a list of bits back into a string by 
# grouping them into bytes and converting each to a character.

# Question: Why does DES use 64-bit blocks?
# Answer: DES was designed to process 64-bit blocks of data, 
# balancing security and performance for hardware in the 1970s.

# Question: What is simplified in this DES implementation?
# Answer: The full 16-round structure, expansion, S-boxes, 
# and full key schedule are removed. Only a simple XOR and 
# 1 round of left-right swapping are shown.

# Question: How is the `simple_round()` function working?
# Answer: It just swaps the halves and applies XOR between 
# the left half and part of the key bits.

# Question: What is the purpose of final permutation (FP)?
# Answer: FP is the inverse of IP. It brings the bits back 
# to the original order after rounds of encryption.

# Question: How are keys represented in this code?
# Answer: The key is an 8-character string converted to 
# a list of bits. This mimics the 64-bit DES key input.

# Question: Is this code secure like real DES?
# Answer: No. This is only a learning tool. Real DES uses 
# multiple rounds, substitution boxes, and key scheduling 
# for stronger encryption.

# Question: What is the significance of using XOR in the round?
# Answer: XOR is used to mix key bits with data bits. 
# It's reversible, which is crucial for decryption.

# Question: How does this code perform decryption?
# Answer: It reverses the encryption steps by swapping 
# halves back and reapplying the same XOR with the key.

# Question: What happens if the plaintext or key is not 8 characters?
# Answer: Since DES operates on 64-bit blocks, input must 
# be exactly 8 characters (8 bytes = 64 bits), or else 
# the code may fail or behave unpredictably.

# Question: What is the role of swapping halves?
# Answer: In real DES, swapping is part of the round 
# structure to enable mixing of the data across rounds.

# Question: How is this implementation helpful?
# Answer: It helps in understanding how DES works at 
# a high level â€” particularly permutations, bitwise 
# operations, and left-right processing.

# Question: What is the time complexity of this code?
# Answer: O(n), where n is the number of bits processed. 
# Since DES works on fixed-size blocks, it's constant 
# per block, i.e., O(1) per 64-bit block.

# Question: Can this be extended to full DES?
# Answer: Yes, but it would require implementing all 16 
# rounds, proper key schedule, expansion, S-boxes, and 
# Feistel function as defined in DES.
