<!-- Question: What is the Diffie-Hellman key exchange? -->
<!-- Answer: It is a cryptographic method allowing two parties to -->
<!-- securely generate a shared secret over an insecure channel. -->

<!-- Question: What are the public values in this example? -->
<!-- Answer: P = 23 (a prime number), G = 9 (a primitive root of P). -->

<!-- Question: Why is G called a primitive root? -->
<!-- Answer: Because G generates all numbers from 1 to P-1 modulo P, -->
<!-- which is required for Diffie-Hellman to work securely. -->

<!-- Question: What is Alice's private key in this simulation? -->
<!-- Answer: It is the value entered by the user in the input field. -->

<!-- Question: What is Bob's private key here? -->
<!-- Answer: It's simulated with a fixed value of b = 15 in JavaScript. -->

<!-- Question: How is the public key computed? -->
<!-- Answer: Using the formula (G^private_key) mod P. -->

<!-- Question: What is Alice's public key expression? -->
<!-- Answer: x = (G^a) mod P, where a is Alice's private key. -->

<!-- Question: What is Bob's public key expression? -->
<!-- Answer: y = (G^b) mod P, where b is Bob's private key. -->

<!-- Question: How is the shared secret computed by Alice? -->
<!-- Answer: ka = (y^a) mod P, using Bob's public key and Alice's private key. -->

<!-- Question: How is the shared secret computed by Bob? -->
<!-- Answer: kb = (x^b) mod P, using Alice's public key and Bob's private key. -->

<!-- Question: Should Alice and Bob get the same shared key? -->
<!-- Answer: Yes, both sides compute the same shared key if all -->
<!-- values are correct and operations are done modulo P. -->

<!-- Question: Is Math.pow() accurate for cryptographic use? -->
<!-- Answer: Not really. For security, use modular exponentiation -->
<!-- with large integers and avoid floating-point Math.pow(). -->

<!-- Question: Why is Diffie-Hellman secure? -->
<!-- Answer: Because while public keys are shared, it's hard to find -->
<!-- the private key (discrete logarithm problem) without brute force. -->

<!-- Question: Is this implementation secure for real applications? -->
<!-- Answer: No. It's a basic simulation. Real DH uses large primes -->
<!-- and secure modular arithmetic libraries (e.g., BigInt or crypto). -->

<!-- Question: What would happen if P is not prime? -->
<!-- Answer: The security breaks, and G may not act as a proper -->
<!-- generator, making the key exchange unreliable. -->

<!-- Question: What can attackers observe in this exchange? -->
<!-- Answer: Attackers see P, G, x, and y but cannot deduce the shared -->
<!-- key without solving the discrete log problem. -->

<!-- Question: Why do we simulate Bob instead of real input? -->
<!-- Answer: For simplicity. In real cases, both parties enter -->
<!-- private values and exchange computed public keys. -->

<!-- Question: Can Diffie-Hellman be used alone for encryption? -->
<!-- Answer: No. It's only for securely exchanging a shared secret, -->
<!-- which is then used in symmetric encryption like AES. -->
